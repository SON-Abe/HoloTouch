HoloTouch is my senior design project that integrates hand gesture recognition with a holographic display system, allowing users to control a computer through intuitive hand movements. The project utilizes an enclosed box with an acrylic panel set at a 45Â° angle, a front-facing camera, LED lights, and a display powered by an Nvidia Jetson Nano, employing MediaPipe for hand tracking and PyAutoGUI for gesture-based computer interactions.
